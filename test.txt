This is a test file for Terminal-Link file transfer demonstration.

Features being tested:
- Chunked file transfer (64KB chunks)
- SHA256 verification
- Progress tracking
- Resume capability infrastructure

The file transfer system includes:
1. File metadata exchange
2. Chunked data transfer with checksums
3. Acknowledgment system
4. Final integrity verification

This file should be small enough to transfer quickly for testing purposes.
